##Details
Game Title: The Flame in the Flood
##Summary
The Flame in the Flood is a game about surviving a post-apocalyptic land ravaged by flooding.
The player character Scout and her dog Aesop travel by navigating their raft down a river.
Along the way, the player must visit the islands dotted along the river to scavenge for supplies.
Different islands have different types of settlements, and the player will often be forced to choose one out of several to visit, as the river's constant flow makes visiting every location in the game impossible.
The player must tend to Scout's hunger, thirst, warmth, exhaustion, and any injuries or illnesses she suffers.
In addition to finding food, water, and places to sleep, a variety of tools and clothing can be crafted from gathered materials that improve Scout's survivability against the elements and hostile wildlife.
Neglecting any of Scout's needs can lead to her death.
When Scout dies, the player must start from the beginning, though some of Scout's inventory can be given to Aesop and saved for the next playthrough.
In addition to the normal mode, the game offers a harder difficulty and an endless mode.
##Final Thoughts
Even on its base difficulty, the game feels harder than it should be.
Food and water are very scarce, and most types of food staves off very little hunger.
Survival tools are also hard to acquire, as certain items necessary for hunting as well as defense from wildlife require highly upgraded versions of other tools.
This wouldn't be so much of a problem if hostile wildlife appeared later on in the playthrough, but they can and often do appear on the first few islands, with the player's only recourse being to run.
There is definitely fun to be had, but the punishing difficulty means that fun can come and go at any time.
