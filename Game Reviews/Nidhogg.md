## Summary
Nidhogg is a 2D fighting game with a focus on swordplay. Two players, or one player versus the computer, fight to the death. Each player has a simple set of actions available to them: forward and backward movement, a jump, a midair dive kick, and attacks with their sword. In addition to three heights for forward sword thrusts, players can also throw their swords, leaving them with just their fists until they either die or pick up another sword. However, death is only the beginning. The ultimate goal is for either player to make it to their respective opposite side of the area to progress to the next screen. To be eligible to progress to the next screen, a player must kill their opponent at least once and have the most recent kill. When a player is killed, they will respawn after their opponent makes a certain amount of forward progress, giving them a chance to kill their assailant and progress to the next screen. There is online play in addition to local one- or two-player matches, as well as a customizable tournament mode that can have up to eight players.
## Final Thoughts
Nidhogg is, at first glance, a simple experience. In many ways, this is a fair assessment, but there is definitely a good amount of depth to the game. The core gameplay is intuitive enough that you could pick it up and play for ten minutes, or become so engrossed in it that you play for an hour. I would say the game's biggest weakness is its single-player content. At the time of writing, the game has been out for more than four years, and most players have moved on to other titles. Indeed, I could not find an opponent in online matchmaking, and while the AI in the single-player mode is refreshingly challenging, it doesn't carry with it the same competitive tension as a human opponent, meaning the game does eventually get old.
