# Game Testing Concepts

## Two important skills for being a game tester
Inquisitiveness - Upon finding a bug, a tester should be concerned with two things: the cause of the bug, and if the bug can be reproduced.

Creativity - A tester should be constantly thinking of and trying different things that could potentially break the game.
## Hardest thing about being a tester
While not necessarily difficult, a tester will often need to repeatedly perform specific actions to make sure the game does not break. This repetition of any given action can take days of attention, which is inevitably mind-numbing to the tester.
## An interesting thing about being a tester
One of the responsibilities of a tester is to evaluate the enjoyability of a game. I had previously viewed videogame testing as an endeavor strictly focused on the structural soundness of the game, where it only matters if the game can be broken. This is not the case, however. A valuable aspect of game testing is making sure that the game is fun to play.
